(Wikipedia contributors 2019) Theorem 3.1 (Compound interest upper bound) In a bank account containing \\(1\\) unit of a certain currency, applying a \\(100\\%\\) interest rate on the account divided into \\(n\\) times throughout the whole year would yield at the end of the year \\(e\\) units of the currency as \\(n\\) approaches infinity. \\[ \\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow +\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{n} \\right)^n = e \\] 3.2 Exponential function The exponential function is defined as \\[ exp:x\\mapsto e^x \\] Here’s the graph of the function (hidden python code chunk) References "],

There’s also a cherry on top, since it is common to repeat a few mathematical expressions throughout the document and it’s pretty annoying to rewrite the same expression over and over again, I usually use LaTeX macros that are stored in include/abbrev.tex to avoid repition and make the raw markdown file more readable. For example, instead of writing \\mathbb{N} each time I want to write the set of natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) I simply write \\N. "],
