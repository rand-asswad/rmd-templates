# Napier's constant (Euler's number)

## Definition

Napier's constant can be defined in different ways, here's one:
```{definition, name="Napier's constant"}
The number $\mathbf{e}$ is defined as the limit of the converging series
$$ e = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} $$
```
It is to be noted that the constant was discovered by the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli while studying compound interest. [@wiki:e]
```{theorem, name="Compound interest upper bound"}
In a bank account containing $1$ unit of a certain currency,
applying a $100\%$ interest rate on the account divided into $n$ times
throughout the whole year would yield at the end of the year $e$ units of the currency
as $n$ approaches infinity.
$$ \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow +\infty} \pp{1 + \frac{1}{n}}^n = e $$
```

## Exponential function
The exponential function is defined as $$ exp:x\mapsto e^x $$
Here's the graph of the function *(hidden python code chunk)*


```{python, echo=FALSE}
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-3, +3)
y = np.exp(x)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)
ax.set(title="The Exponential Function")
ax.grid()

plt.show()
```
