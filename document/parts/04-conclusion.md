# Conclusion

This document covered a mathematical example featuring equations, theorems, graphs, and code.

There's also a cherry on top, since it is common to repeat a few mathematical expressions throughout the document
and it's pretty annoying to rewrite the same expression over and over again, I usually use LaTeX macros that are stored
in `include/abbrev.tex` to avoid repition and make the raw markdown file more readable. For example, instead of writing `\mathbb{N}`
each time I want to write the set of natural numbers $\N$ I simply write `\N`.
